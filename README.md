# The Thinking Home / Automations

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical companion to **"The Thinking Home: A Practical Guide to Planning and Building a Reliable and Private Smart Home"** by James Lander. It provides a curated collection of Home Assistant automations and scripts, meticulously designed to embody the book's core principles of **Intelligent Sovereignty**, **Local Control**, and **Intentional Planning**.

The automations within this repository are crafted to enhance your home's comfort, security, and efficiency while safeguarding your privacy by prioritizing local processing and minimizing reliance on cloud services. These examples aim to help you plan, build, and refine intelligent automations using the IF-AND-THEN model, employing an iterative approach by adding layers of complexity one at a time.
