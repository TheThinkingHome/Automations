# The Thinking Home / Automations

## Purpose

[cite_start]This repository serves as a practical companion to **"The Thinking Home: A Practical Guide to Planning and Building a Reliable and Private Smart Home"** by James Lander[cite: 22, 24, 4]. [cite_start]It provides a curated collection of Home Assistant automations and scripts, meticulously designed to embody the book's core principles of **Intelligent Sovereignty**, **Local Control**, and **Intentional Planning**[cite: 24, 25, 26, 128, 130, 132].

[cite_start]The automations within this repository are crafted to enhance your home's comfort, security, and efficiency while safeguarding your privacy by prioritizing local processing and minimizing reliance on cloud services[cite: 25, 130, 592]. [cite_start]These examples aim to help you plan, build, and refine intelligent automations using the IF-AND-THEN model, employing an iterative approach by adding layers of complexity one at a time[cite: 845, 846, 2989, 2990].
