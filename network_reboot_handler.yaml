alias: System - Network Reboot Handler
description: >-
  (Version 1.0.1) This automation provides a fault-tolerant solution to prevent
  a cascade of errors from network-dependent integrations during the scheduled
  nightly reboot of the network router.

  The automation's primary goal is to gracefully manage the state of sensitive
  integrations by proactively disabling them before the network goes down and
  re-enabling them only after the network has fully recovered. This prevents the
  Home Assistant logs from being flooded with timeout, DNS, and connection
  errors, and ensures a more stable startup for the affected components.

  The process is initiated by a single time-based trigger at 3:00 AM, one
  minute before the scheduled router reboot. It then proceeds with the
  following actions:
  1. Disables a predefined list of network-sensitive integrations (e.g.,
  Frigate, Reolink, Motion Blinds).
  2. Pauses its execution and waits for a trigger from a network sensor, which
  indicates that the router has rebooted and is back online.
  3. This wait has a configurable timeout to handle cases where the network does
  not recover as expected.

  If the network sensor comes online within the timeout period (the success
  path), the automation logs the success and waits an additional two minutes for
  network services to fully stabilize. If the network sensor does not come
  online within the timeout period (the failure path), the automation logs a warning and
  sends a persistent notification to alert the user. Regardless of the outcome,
  the automation will always re-enable the integrations as the final step to
  ensure the system returns to an operational state. All key parameters are
  defined in a variables block for easy modification.
